            <p>This website accommodates various activities needed by students in completing college assignments. On the
                website there are documents in the form of word, pptx, pdf, and others. All are packaged in one cool
                website by PGSD students. Read more for procedures for using the site.</p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Introducing Student
                Representative Council</h4>
            <p>Class A 24 is one of the first grouping classes of the 24th batch of Nahdlatul Ulama University, Blitar.
                In this class there are 35 students, 9 males, and 26 females. Like classes in general, class A24 also
                has a class structure. The structure of class A24 is divided into 5 divisions contained in the Student
                Representative Council. This council regulates all student activities, both inside and outside the
                classroom. The DPM structure itself is divided into 5 components which include, Chairperson, Vice
                Chairperson or Secretary, Treasurer, Advisor, and PJMK. They have their own duties. We will explain
                these duties in the next paragraph.</p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Duties of Each Division</h4>
            <p>The chairman is the head of the main division in the student representative council structure. His duties
                are to oversee the running of the government, create work programs, open meetings (internal and
                external), and manage student order. A chairman also has a mission, where the mission will be the
                benchmark in running a government.
                The secretary is the chairman's personal assistant in implementing programs and overseeing the running
                of the government. He is given the authority to check everything that is a class problem. The secretary
                also helps in solving problems that sometimes never get resolved. So, overall the secretary's job is to
                be an assistant to the chairman.
                The treasurer is also no less important in a structure. Finance, administrative problems, and cash are
                under the control of the treasurer. Recording the flow of money in and out, withdrawing cash, and
                assisting in class management.
                The advisor is a personal assistant who is tasked with providing solutions to class problems. This
                division is very important, because the information given will greatly influence the welfare of
                students. Usually the advisor is the oldest person in the class. The older, the wiser the solution
                given.
                PJMK is the person in charge of the class course. The task of PJMK is as a reference or representative
                of the lecturer to deliver the assignments given. PJMK is also involved in listening to the aspirations
                of students. Capturing every aspiration and conveying it to the internal division structure of DPM.</p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Class A24 is an elite class with high intellectuality. The structure of this class is very complex,
                starting from the chairman, vice or secretary, treasurer, advisor, and PJMK. Each division has its own
                role, the chairman as the head of government, the secretary as his assistant, the treasurer as the
                financial division, the advisor as the personal assistant to the chairman, and PJMK as the
                representative of the lecturer and the bearer of student aspirations. Of the many explanations above,
                this class is the coolest class with the best management in its time.</p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5"style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Closing</h4>
            <p>In this closing section, I as the class leader of A24 would like to thank the cooperation that has been
                given by each division. Especially to PJMK who has taken the time to receive all the orders that have
                been given by the lecturers and convey them to the students. I think that is the hardest task in the
                structure of this class. As explained at the beginning of the opening, this class is a class with the
                best intellectuality ever. Thank you also to all students who have given their aspirations to us, we
                hope that all the aspirations that have been given have been discussed as well as possible, thank you.
